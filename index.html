        <h1>OZ: The Great and Powerful</h1>
        <p> I am at the point in my life where i have favorites
            of things such as movies and perhaps find some meaning
            in them and attach my identity to them. 
        </p>
        <p> My top three movies are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2:22 (2017)</li>
            <li>OZ: The Great and Powerful</li>
            <li>The Parent Trap</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I rewatched OZ yesterday (19/03/24) and gained a 
        new level of respect for the movie. That respect is What
        i wish to impart to you. I believe this a great movie for 
        three important reasons
        <ol>
            <li> The Shift between worlds</li>
            <br>
            OZ (The Movie) does something unique in the way it handles the movement
            or shift between worlds. The movie starts of with a monochrome colour scheme
            and a 4:3 aspect ratio which changes to a more vibrant world (and the standard 16:9)
            when we and OZ enters the land that bears his name. It's a beautiful act of filmaking 
            that i think you should experience.
            <li> Character Development</li>
            OZ (The Wizard) is asked by a young girl while in kansas to make her stand.
            It is almost heartbreaking especially since we, the audience, realise that he is 
            merely a charlatan and trickster unable to do that which she asks.
            It is then fitting that his first ture act of magic on getting to OZ is to
            fix the broken legs of a china girl. 
            <li> The True Nature of Love</li>
            <br>
            Oscar Diggs (other than being a trickster) is also a charming 
            ladies man and a change of worlds doesnt chnage him, despite his ways
            landing him in trouble previously, setting him on the path that led to OZ.
            <br>
            He first uses his charms on a young, naive witch who is later heartbroken due to the machinations 
            and lies of her sister which leads to her becoming the second evil witch of OZ.
            <br>
            One could say (and i am) that this only happens becasue he tries to present a 
            false version of himself to the young lady.
            <br>
            On the contrary, his love interest in the movie, Glinda the Good (or perhaps Glenda)
            recognizes him for who he is or rather was and by so doing helps him to achieve true greatness
            and lead to the deliverance of the good people of OZ
            <p>
                This i think is a fitting lesson in present times when we all
                seem to believe (after being told) that we need to present a false
                image of ourselves in the name of branding.
            </p>

            <p>
                With that being said, I hope you take some time to watch it (along with the other two!)
                and most importantly, Let's be Great!
